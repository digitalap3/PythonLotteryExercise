#A NEW BEGINNING

moving this repo from a private to here.  Going to start rewriting this code with newest things I've learned and with a concentration on making it readable and well documented, not just on results.

Plans for the future:

- put numbers into a database
- mark winning numbers
- make it a web application using Flask
