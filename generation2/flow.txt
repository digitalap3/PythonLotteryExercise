run: 
ask which game to perform operations on
(check to see if first number changed in json file?)

code:
instantiate class list creator
- creates (empty dict-do this in histogram?)  and list, recieves file choice, starts count at 0
- choose either 5 result or single result
 - function for each
  - open chosen file, creates and returns master list and count number of results
  
  run:
  master list and count recieved, choose dicts to create or have a set of them automatically created
  
  full list count
  
  code:
  instantiate class dict counter
  init : empty dict
  function histogram-get recieves list
  returns dictionary with counts
  
  name of file - create master list - create new list from master based on slice - feed new list through histogram to get dictionary of counts - present data from dictionary or manipulate output (create tuples, reverse key value,etc) then present

3 files:

user input
actions to produce output
   combine the two above??
list/dict creator

ask for game - check to see if file for lists - if yes then move on - if no ask to overwrite
                                          (2nd gen)    then check check first numbers match
                                                       if yes then move on
                                                       if no overwrite
