Playing with lottery numbers using Python

I have found that playing around with lottery numbers is an excellent way to practice Python.  The usefulness grows as I learn more since there are so many ways to gather the numbers, play with data, represent data, create and manipulate dictionaries and lists, etc, etc.

It is a very nice way to watch my understanding grow as well, looking back on the first simple iterations and seeing the complexity grow as I try to learn.  The code here is only a small part of my personal repo.

Again this has been and will continue to be an excellent independent project, seperate from any book or tutorial and therefore forcing me to find answers on my own and to implement what I am learning in a different way from what is presented.

I have yet to win anything from these scripts, but if someone uses them and hits the big one, well please don't forget about this little guy toiling away in the corner....
